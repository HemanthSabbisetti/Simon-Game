# Simon-Game

It is a kind of memory game. There are four buttons, a particular sound is assigned to each button. When the user presses any key it will generate a random number, corresponding to that random number a button will be pressed randomly. Then the user turns to press that button in the same order from the beginning, if the user completed the sequence then it will randomly press another button and the level will increase. If the user presses a wrong sequence then it will play another sound to indicate game over.
